IoT Surveillance Camera System using a Raspberry Pi &amp; PIR Sensor

Developed an IoT Surveillance Camera which takes a 10-second video using an infrared camera connected to the Raspberry Pi when motion is detected using a PIR sensor which is connected to the GPIO ports and saves the file in a folder with the current date and time for ease of access. With the implementation of a web server, the live feed of the camera can be accessed remotely.
